        Sum of two bits can be obtained by performing XOR (^) of the two bits. 
        Carry bit can be obtained by performing AND (&) of two bits.
        Above is simple Half Adder logic that can be used to add 2 single bits. 
        We can extend this logic for integers. 
        If x and y donâ€™t have set bits at same position(s), then bitwise XOR (^) of x and y gives the sum of x and y. 
        To incorporate common set bits also, bitwise AND (&) is used. 
        Bitwise AND of x and y gives all carry bits. We calculate (x & y) << 1 and add it to x ^ y to get the required result.
